# tRPC Azure Functions
An Azure Functions adapter for tRPC.

This project aims to enhance the development Azure Functions with tRPC features:
 - Input / Output parsing with zod
 - Type safety

## Status
This project is currently on hold because Microsoft is working on overhoaling the Azure Functions workflow.
Documentation is kinda rough atm and I'm not currently working with Azure Functions so this isn't a priority for me.
